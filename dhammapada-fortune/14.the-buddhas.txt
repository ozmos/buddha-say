He whose victory may not be undone, a victory unrivaled in all the world; by what track would you trace that Buddha, who leaves no track in his infinite range?

Of craving, the weaver, the clinger, he has none: so where can he be traced? By what track would you trace that Buddha, who leaves no track in his infinite range? 
%
The attentive intent on absorption, who love the peace of renunciation, the Buddhas, ever mindful, are envied by even the gods. 
%
It’s hard to gain a human birth; the life of mortals is hard; it’s hard to hear the true teaching; the arising of Buddhas is hard. 
%
Not to do any evil; to embrace the good; to purify one’s mind: this is the instruction of the Buddhas. 
%
Patient acceptance is the ultimate fervor. Extinguishment is the ultimate, say the Buddhas. No true renunciate injures another, nor does an ascetic hurt another. 
%
Not speaking ill nor doing harm; restraint in the monastic code; moderation in eating; staying in remote lodgings; commitment to the higher mind—this is the instruction of the Buddhas. 
%
Even if it were raining money, you’d not be sated in sensual pleasures. An astute person understands that sensual pleasures offer little gratification and much suffering. 
%
Thus they find no delight even in celestial pleasures. A disciple of the fully awakened Buddha delights in the ending of craving. 
%
So many go for refuge to mountains and forest groves, to tree-shrines in tended parks; those people are driven by fear. 
%
But such refuge is no sanctuary, it is no supreme refuge. By going to that refuge, you’re not released from all suffering. 
%
One gone for refuge to the Buddha, to his teaching and to the Saṅgha, sees the four noble truths with right understanding: 
%
suffering, suffering’s origin, suffering’s transcendence, and the noble eightfold path that leads to the stilling of suffering. 
%
Such refuge is a sanctuary, it is the supreme refuge. By going to that refuge, you’re released from all suffering. 
%
It’s hard to find a thoroughbred man: they’re not born just anywhere. A family where that sage is born prospers in happiness. 
%
Happy, the arising of Buddhas! Happy, the teaching of Dhamma! Happy is the harmony of the Saṅgha, and the striving of the harmonious is happy. 
%
When a person venerates the worthy—the Buddha or his disciple, who have transcended proliferation, and have left behind grief and lamentation, 
%
quenched, fearing nothing from any quarter—the merit of one venerating such as these, cannot be calculated by anyone, saying it is just this much.
